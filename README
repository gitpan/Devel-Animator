NAME
    Devel::Animator - Watch program flow like a movie

SYNOPSIS
      perl -d:Animator program


DESCRIPTION
     Animator lets you run a program and watch program flow. You can
   stop animation and start it again, reverse direction from forward
   to backwards, and backwards to forward. You can change the 
   animation speed from 10 milliseconds to 2000 milliseconds between
   statements.


DETAILS
    Animation doesn't start until meta-data has been completely 
  generated. The Animator should be used with small data sets.


TODO
    *  allow the animation of selected portions of code 

    *  allow suppressing of animating certain packages
